# On-Chain Subscription System (BlockSub)

## 📌 Project Description
BlockSub is an on-chain subscription management system built using Solidity. It enables creators and developers to offer subscription-based services without relying on centralized platforms. Payments, renewals, and cancellations are handled transparently via smart contracts.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To democratize recurring payments and empower creators by providing a decentralized, automated, and trustless subscription platform built directly on the blockchain.

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Smart Contract-Based Subscriptions**: All subscription details stored and managed on-chain.
- **Automated Renewals**: Users can renew based on predefined cycles.
- **Transparent Payments**: No intermediaries; funds go directly to the contract owner.
- **Easy Cancellation**: Users can cancel subscriptions anytime.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with ERC-20 tokens instead of ETH.
- Automated scheduled renewals using Chainlink Automation.
- Dashboard UI for creators and subscribers.
- Multi-tier subscription plans.
- NFT-based subscription access.
